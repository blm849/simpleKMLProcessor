        <description><![CDATA[n 22 years of business the Fickle Pickle Restaurant has never closed its doors, until now. We are shocked and in great sorrow, as we know everyone is. This restaurant in this community means the world to our family. We have put our heart and souls into it and have truly enjoyed serving such a wonderful community. We feel at such a great loss and having to lay off such a wonderful devoted staff pains us deeply. The only light in all this is that we are still able to offer take-out and delivery service to you. Knowing that this was probably going to happen we partnered up with Uber Eats delivery service, which is now up and running and we are presently working on partnering up with Skip The Dishes as well (Skip The Dishes should be up and running by the end of the week). We will continue to offer our regular call in take-out and pick-up at our regular menu price as well.<br>Know that, as posted on our front door (see photo) we are taking all precautions and maintaining all recommended safety measures is essential to us. Your health and safety and that of our staff is of the utmost importance to us. We ask that in these trying times we come together as a strong community and support each other. We appreciate your patronage and look forward to continuing to serve you.<br>https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=the%20fickle%20pickle&epa=SEARCH_BOX]]></description>
